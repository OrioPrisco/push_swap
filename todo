make print substacks debug fct
make sort not systematically unrotate
temp : make split unrotate
then
	make best_strat consider translation
	make more complex split, doing a half upp half down or the opposite

===
local offset is where we want to rotate to when unrotating
global rotatedness is how many rotate up / rotate down where executed

when splitting : set new substacks offset to current rotatedness
increasing or decreasing rotatedness on push seems useless ?
because when we get back to the next substack we will have pushed all the elements back, meaning everythng should be back how it was
rotatedness can be calculated with global_rot - local_rot % stack->size


split_stacks doesn't modify global rot ?
